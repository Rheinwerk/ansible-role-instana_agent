Instana Agent
=========

This role installs the [Instana](https://www.instana.com) Agent.
Ubuntu.

[![Build Status](https://github.com/Rheinwerk/ansible-role-instana_agent/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Rheinwerk/ansible-role-instana_agent/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Requirements
------------

The Instana Agent is a customer specific download. To download it, you
need to include a license key. You can provide it in the `_instana`
dictionary. See *Role Variables*.

Role Variables
--------------

There is one main variable that drives this role: `_instana`. It is a map that contains all configuration and settings for this role.
The access key can be set using this variable.
Please see `defaults/main.yml` for details.

Dependencies
------------

None. Instana brings a packaged Java Runtime.

Example Playbook
----------------

The general contract of this role is to take the variables map `_instana` from `defaults/main.yml` as a template for your configuration and pass that configuration as a parameter to this role.

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      var:
        INSTANA:
          ...
      roles:
         - { role: instana_agent, tags: [ 'instana' ], _instana: "{{ INSTANA }}" }
